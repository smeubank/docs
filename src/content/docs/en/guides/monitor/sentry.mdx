[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome) offers a comprehensive application monitoring and error tracking service designed to help developers identify, diagnose, and resolve issues in real-time.

Sentry's Astro SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and tracing data in your Astro application.

## Project Configuration

A full list of pre-requisites can be found in Sentry Astro docs [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/#prerequisites).

### Install, Configure and Verify

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime.

<Steps>
1. Install the SDK by using the astro CLI:

    ```bash
    npx astro add @sentry/astro
    ```
    The astro CLI installs the SDK package and adds the Sentry integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file.

    To finish the setup, configure the Sentry integration.

2. Configure Get started by adding your DSN to your `astro.config.mjs`:

    ```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={2, 6-12}
    import {defineConfig} from 'astro/config';
    import sentry from '@sentry/astro';

    export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [
        sentry({
          dsn: 'https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0',
          sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
          project: 'example-project',
          authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
          },
        }),
      ],
    });
    ```
    Once you've added your dsn, the SDK will automatically capture and send errors and performance events to Sentry.

3. Verify

    ```js title="home.astro" 
    <button onclick="throw new Error('This is a test error')">Throw test error</button>
    ```

</Steps>
